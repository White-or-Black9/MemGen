# Decision Log

Record important architectural, experimental, and scope choices. Use immutable
IDs and append superseding decisions rather than silently rewriting history.

## Decision Index

| ID | Date | Status | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEC-0001 | 2026-06-11 | accepted | Modify inference only; preserve Weaver and Trigger training workflows |
| DEC-0002 | 2026-06-11 | accepted | Disabled memory bank must preserve exact original behavior |
| DEC-0003 | 2026-06-11 | accepted | Phase 1 memory is session-local, non-shared, and defaults to batch size 1 |
| DEC-0004 | 2026-06-11 | accepted | Execute one Phase at a time and pause after completion |

## Standing Decisions

### DEC-0001: Inference-Only Research Scope

- Date: 2026-06-11
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Do not modify Weaver or Trigger training workflows.
- Consequence: All method integration and state management must occur in inference paths.

### DEC-0002: Strict Disabled-Path Compatibility

- Date: 2026-06-11
- Status: accepted
- Decision: `latent_memory_bank.enabled=false` must produce exactly the original behavior.
- Consequence: The disabled path must avoid new state, retrieval, mutation, and numerical effects.

### DEC-0003: Phase 1 Isolation

- Date: 2026-06-11
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Do not share memory across samples in Phase 1; default to `batch_size=1`.
- Consequence: Memory lifecycle must be explicitly bound to one session/sample.

### DEC-0004: Phase Execution Gate

- Date: 2026-06-11
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Execute one approved Phase, update required notes, then pause.
- Consequence: No automatic progression to the next Phase.
